########### README file ###########
# This README file was made to simplify the usage of the yocto project with the image/container created with the assossiated Dockerfile

########### infos ###########
# The script "autobuild.sh" automates the creation of the image and launch of a container 
# a directory "yocto" will be created in the working directory (if it doesn't exist) and mapped to the container
# at least 30GB of free disk space will be needed at the first usage of this project ( to download the necessary files needed for the build of images
# the script must NOT be executed with root privilidges
# in case already created, the user who launches the script must have r/w permissions to the directories assossiated (yocto/output)

########### usage ###########
# ./autobuild.sh <version> //default is 'latest'
# after running the container: execute the "source $YOCTO_SRC_DIR/poky/oe-init-build-env" then "bitbake <image>" under the "$YOCTO_OUTPUT_DIR/build" dirictory to start building
